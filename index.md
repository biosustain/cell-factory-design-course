## General information

This two-day hands-on workshop covers the basics of constraint-based modeling of metabolism with a focus on cell factory engineering. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

**Who**: The course is aimed at graduate students and other researchers. You do need a basic working knowledge of Python in order to follow the course.

**Where**: Room 207, Building 223, 2800 Kgs. Lyngby. Get directions with OpenStreetMap or Google Maps.

**Requirements**: Participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on. They should have a few specific software packages installed (the setup instruction can be found [here](setup)). They are also required to abide by Software Carpentry's Code of Conduct.
